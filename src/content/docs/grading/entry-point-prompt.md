## §18 Entry-Point Prompt

Empty context (see [`02-eligibility.md`](./02-eligibility.md) §3.5) is a convention — it needs an **operational anchor**. The entry-point prompt is that anchor: the first prompt after `/clear` starts every grading run and binds persona, selection/schema, mode, and spec version.

### §18.1 Concept

| Term | Definition | Checkable? |
|------|------------|------------|
| Empty context | Convention: no relevant prior information | No, trust-based |
| Entry-point prompt | First prompt after `/clear` = grading start | No, organisational |

The spec requires: the README in the grading repository provides a prompt template. The grader runs `/clear`, copies the prompt, and fills in persona, selection/single-schema, mode, and the `lockSnapshot` hash from the selection's `index.json`.

### §18.2 Prompt Template

The binding prompt template is:

```
You are performing a FlowMCP grading. Instructions:

1. Persona: crypto-trader-2026
2. Selection: crypto-domain-full, lockSnapshot hash: <sha>
3. Mode: Full (initial baseline)
4. Spec version: gradingSpec/2.0.0
5. Pre-condition: all member schemas have gradingStatus: stable
6. Output format: _gradings/<area>--<timestamp>.json
```

Six numbered lines. For Single-Gradings, line 2 is replaced and line 5 is dropped:

```
1. Persona: crypto-trader-2026
2. Single-Schema: etherscan.getContractEthereum, area: single-test
3. Mode: Full (initial baseline)
4. Spec version: gradingSpec/2.0.0
6. Output format: _gradings/<area>--<timestamp>.json
```

(Line 5 is dropped — the pre-condition applies only to aggregated checks, see [`21-pre-conditions.md`](./21-pre-conditions.md) §20.)

### §18.3 Personas Obligation

The personas obligation has two levels — spec obligation and convention. They are complementary (not alternative).

| Level | Applies to | Anchoring |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Spec obligation** | Selection only | `personaIds[]` is a mandatory field in `selection.json` (see [`16-selection-lockfile.md`](./16-selection-lockfile.md) §11.1) |
| **Convention via prompt** | Single AND Selection | Every grading run starts with the persona line in the prompt (line 1) |

Rationale: Single-Gradings without a persona anchor produce evaluation drift. The spec obligation in `selection.json` is the formal anchoring; the prompt requirement is the operational one.

**Personas-obligation summary:**

- Selection-Gradings: persona **MUST** be in `selection.json` AND in the prompt
- Single-Gradings: persona **SHOULD** be in the prompt (organisational, not a spec-mandatory field)

### §18.4 Cross-Reference to the README

The README in the grading repository contains the ready-to-use prompt with example values. The README section anchors the entry-point prompt and the personas obligation in a single block.

### §18.5 Cross-Refs

- Empty-context convention → [`02-eligibility.md`](./02-eligibility.md) §3.5
- Personas contract (Lens, four personas) → [`12-personas-contract.md`](./12-personas-contract.md)
- Selection `personaIds[]` obligation → [`16-selection-lockfile.md`](./16-selection-lockfile.md) §11.1
- Pre-condition (line 5 of the prompt) → [`21-pre-conditions.md`](./21-pre-conditions.md) §20
- Output format `_gradings/` (line 6 of the prompt) → [`19-folder-layout.md`](./19-folder-layout.md) §17.3
