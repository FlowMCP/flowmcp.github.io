## §11 Selection Definition + Lock Snapshot

In 1.1.0 the member pins lived in a standalone `selection.lock.json` and the provider unit was described by an authored `namespace.json`. Both files are removed in 2.0.0. The pins are folded into the derived `index.json.lockSnapshot`, and the namespace rollup is part of `index.json` (see [`19-folder-layout.md`](./19-folder-layout.md) §17). This section now describes the neutral `selection.json` definition and the frozen `lockSnapshot`.

### §11.1 `selection.json` (Neutral Definition)

A Selection binds N schemas into a domain coverage. The definition lives in `selection/<sel>--<ts>--<hash8>.json` and contains only the *intentional* definition — no pinned hashes and no snapshot version keys.

```json
{
  "selectionId": "crypto-domain-full",
  "namespace": "crypto-domain-full",
  "name": "Crypto Domain (full coverage)",
  "version": "flowmcp/4.0.0",
  "description": "Full-coverage crypto domain.",
  "whenToUse": "Use when an agent must cover crypto pricing, balances, and swaps across providers.",
  "personaIds": ["crypto-trader-2026", "crypto-analyst-2026"],
  "members": [{ "schemaId": "binance.ticker" }],
  "skills": [
    { "file": "skills/welcome/welcome--<ts>--<hash8>.mjs" },
    { "file": "skills/chain-selection/chain-selection--<ts>--<hash8>.mjs" }
  ],
  "resources": [],
  "prompts": []
}
```

**Mandatory fields:** `selectionId`, `namespace`, `name`, `version` (FlowMCP format `flowmcp/4.0.0`), `description`, `whenToUse`, `personaIds[]` (min 1), `members[]` (min 1, only `{schemaId}`), `skills[]` (max 4, map form). `resources[]` and `prompts[]` hold only **unique** primitives (import layer).

| Field | Format | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `selectionId` | `[a-z0-9-]+` | unique selection id |
| `namespace` | `[a-z0-9_-]+` | selection namespace |
| `name` | string | human-readable name |
| `version` | `flowmcp/4.\d+.\d+` | FlowMCP spec version (mandatory FlowMCP-Spec field) |
| `description` | string (min 10 chars) | what the selection covers |
| `whenToUse` | string | mandatory trigger sentence — graded as its own field, never collapsed into `description` |
| `personaIds[]` | array (min 1) | mandatory personas — see [`20-entry-point-prompt.md`](./20-entry-point-prompt.md) §18.3 |
| `members[]` | array (min 1) | contained schemas (only `schemaId`) |
| `skills[]` | array (max 4) | bound skills (map / `file` form, see FlowMCP-Spec v4.2.0 SKL018) |

**Removed from the source definition:** `selectionHash`, `aboutHash`, `selectionVersion`. The snapshot identity lives in the filename timestamp and (frozen) in `index.json.lockSnapshot`. `version` (the FlowMCP-format field) stays. See [`15-versioning-axes.md`](./15-versioning-axes.md) §10.1.

### §11.2 `index.json.lockSnapshot` (Frozen Pins, replaces `selection.lock.json`)

The pins that used to live in `selection.lock.json` now live in `index.json.lockSnapshot`. The `index.json` has two natures (see [`19-folder-layout.md`](./19-folder-layout.md) §17.2): a **live rollup** that is recomputed on every rebuild, and a **frozen `lockSnapshot`** that is written **once at grading start** and then **preserved** by the rebuild (not recomputed live). The pre-condition gate reads **only** the frozen part — a point in time — otherwise it would aggregate over unstable members.

```json
{
  "lockSnapshot": {
    "selectionId": "crypto-domain-full",
    "selectionVersion": "2026-05-30T09-00-00Z",
    "selectionHash": "ef67ab12",
    "generatedAt": "2026-05-30T09-00-00Z",
    "members": [
      {
        "schemaId": "binance.ticker",
        "schemaVersion": "2026-05-30T08-12-44Z",
        "schemaHash": "a1b2c3d4",
        "gradingStatus": "stable",
        "override": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**`lockSnapshot` fields:** `selectionId`, `selectionVersion`, `selectionHash`, `generatedAt`; per member `{ schemaId, schemaVersion, schemaHash, gradingStatus, override }`. The `selectionVersion` / `schemaVersion` snapshot values are the filename timestamps frozen at grading start — they do **not** live in the source. `override` salvages the old override mechanism (whitelist `['name', 'description']`).

#### `gradingStatus` field

`gradingStatus` carries the 5-status value of the member node (see [`19-folder-layout.md`](./19-folder-layout.md) §17 and the rollup in `index.json`):

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `pending` | not yet graded |
| `blocked` | cannot be graded yet (carries a `reason`: fewer than 3 tests, no About, API down — repairable) |
| `graded` | a grade is present |
| `stable` | fully graded and over threshold — ready for use |
| `rejected` | veto raised (terminal, irreversible) |

`gradingStatus` is the cheap lock lookup consumed by the pre-condition check (see [`21-pre-conditions.md`](./21-pre-conditions.md) §20). A content change to a member (new file → new `schemaHash`) invalidates `stable`; the next rebuild reflects the new status, but the **frozen** `lockSnapshot` is preserved until a new grading run regenerates it.

### §11.3 Selection-Grading Workflow

The Selection-grading workflow starts with a pre-condition check as step 0. Without it, the grading would aggregate over unstable member evaluations — which makes the result worthless.

```
Step 0 — Pre-condition check (mandatory):
  Read index.json.lockSnapshot; check whether every member has gradingStatus: stable.
  If no: BLOCK + list the blocking members (see [21-pre-conditions](./21-pre-conditions.md) §20 and the
         dependency-resolver decision tree).
  If yes: continue.

Step 1: Selection areas run (about-selection, selection-skills per skill, selection-aggregate).
Step 2: Grading results written to the respective _gradings/ folders.
Step 3: rebuild*Index recomputes the live rollup, preserves the frozen lockSnapshot.
```

> *"You can only grade a Selection over full, stable member gradings — otherwise it simply makes no sense."*

Cross-reference: [`21-pre-conditions.md`](./21-pre-conditions.md) §20 (universal pre-condition obligation).

### §11.4 Member Resolution Manifest

The member resolution manifest (recorded in `index.json`) maps each member `schemaId` to the resolved provider artefact plus its grade and status. Without this manifest the selection aggregate cannot reproduce "M of N members PASS". This is the heart of selection grading. See the `index.json` rollup in [`19-folder-layout.md`](./19-folder-layout.md) §17.

### §11.5 Removed in 2.0.0

| Removed | Replacement |
|---------|-------------|
| `selection.lock.json` (standalone file) | `index.json.lockSnapshot` (§11.2) |
| `namespace.json` (authored payload) | `index.json` rollup (see [`19-folder-layout.md`](./19-folder-layout.md) §17) |
| in-source `selectionHash`, `aboutHash`, `selectionVersion` | filename timestamp + `index.json` (see [`15-versioning-axes.md`](./15-versioning-axes.md) §10) |

The annex schemas `selection.lock.schema.json` and `namespace.schema.json` are **deprecated** — they describe removed files and are retained only for historical reference. New tooling MUST NOT validate against them.
