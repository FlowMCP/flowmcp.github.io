## Pre-Conditions

This section is the **central anchoring point** for the pre-condition obligation. It was generalised from the Selection pre-condition to a **universal rule**: all aggregated checks (Selection-Gradings, About verifications) are blocked until all member schemas carry `gradingStatus: stable`.

### Universal Rule

> Aggregated checks (all checks that operate across multiple schemas — namely Selection-Gradings and About verifications) are blocked until ALL member schemas in the current `index.json.lockSnapshot` carry `gradingStatus: "stable"`.

The member status is read from the frozen `lockSnapshot` block of the selection's `index.json` (the point-in-time snapshot written once at grading start), not from a separate lockfile. Each member's `gradingStatus` is one of the five-status enum: `pending`, `blocked`, `graded`, `stable`, `rejected`. Only `stable` passes the gate; every other status (including the terminal `rejected`) blocks the aggregated check.

This rule is universal. It is made concrete in [`16-selection-lockfile.md`](/grading/selection-lockfile/) (Selection workflow step 0) and [`11-about-convention.md`](/grading/about-convention/) (About verification step 0), but anchored here.

### Stable Definition

A schema has `gradingStatus: "stable"` when the last operation in its `_gradings/` folder was a `mode: "full"` grading with `aggregateGrade` in `{A, B}` (see [`06-determinism-and-tier.md`](/grading/determinism-and-tier/)).

Schema bumps (`schemaHash` changes, see [`15-versioning-axes.md`](/grading/versioning-axes/)) invalidate `stable` — the status falls back to `"pending"`. Rationale: a new `schemaHash` means, by definition, that the schema object was changed — the previous evaluation no longer applies.

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Last grading `mode=full` AND `aggregateGrade in {A,B}` | `stable` |
| Last grading `mode=full` AND `aggregateGrade in {C,D,F}` | `graded` |
| Categorical Veto raised (`aggregateGrade: REJECTED`) | `rejected` (terminal, irreversible) |
| Cannot be graded yet (fewer than 3 tests, no About, API down) | `blocked` (with `reason`) |
| Last grading `mode=partial` (any grade) | stays at the last full status |
| `schemaHash` changed since the last full grading | `pending` (invalidated) |
| Never run a `mode=full` grading | `pending` |

Only `stable` passes the pre-condition gate. `pending`, `blocked`, `graded`, and the terminal `rejected` all block the aggregated check.

### Scope of Application

The pre-condition applies to **aggregated checks**, not to tier-level checks:

| Check | Pre-condition active? |
|-------|----------------------|
| Single-Grading | No (tier level, no aggregation) |
| Selection-Grading | Yes (all members stable per `index.json.lockSnapshot`) |
| About verification (namespace) | Yes (all namespace members stable per `index.json.lockSnapshot`) |
| About verification (selection) | Yes (all selection members stable per `index.json.lockSnapshot`) |

Four check classes, three of them subject to the pre-condition.

### Block Behaviour

When the pre-condition is not met:

- The check is **aborted** (BLOCK)
- The list of `pending` members is output (toolchain requirement)
- Recommended follow-up action: complete the missing Single-Gradings

Example output (toolchain):

```
PRE-CONDITION FAILED — selection-grading blocked
Selection: crypto-domain-full
Source: selections/crypto-domain-full/index.json (lockSnapshot)
Non-stable Members:
  - binance.ticker (schemaHash a1b2c3d4, gradingStatus: graded)
  - jupiter.swap (schemaHash c3d4e5f6, gradingStatus: pending)
Follow-up action: complete the Single-Gradings, then rebuild the index and refreeze the lockSnapshot.
```

### Cross-Refs

- Tier trim — full vs. partial → [`06-determinism-and-tier.md`](/grading/determinism-and-tier/)
- Selection workflow step 0 → [`16-selection-lockfile.md`](/grading/selection-lockfile/)
- About verification step 0 → [`11-about-convention.md`](/grading/about-convention/)
- Version bump invalidates `stable` → [`15-versioning-axes.md`](/grading/versioning-axes/)
- Flywheel loop (pre-condition as a gate) → [`18-flywheel-loop.md`](/grading/flywheel-loop/)
- Pre-condition validator implementation (shared between the About and Selection paths) — a later-stage concern
