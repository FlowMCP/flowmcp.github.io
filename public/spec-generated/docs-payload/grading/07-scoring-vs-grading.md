> Conformance language (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) follows BCP 14 [RFC2119]/[RFC8174] as defined in [`00-overview.md`](/grading/overview/). The binding source is the FlowMCP Schemas Specification v4.2.0.

---

## Core Statement

The terms **"Scoring"** and **"Grading"** are used **strictly separately** throughout this specification. They name two different sub-systems with two independent version namespaces. A scoring update does **not** automatically imply a grading update — and vice versa.

A grader, scorer, or aggregator that conforms to `gradingSpec/2.0.0` MUST keep both names — and both version strings — apart in every emitted artefact (grading entries, logs, error codes).

---

## Comparison Table

The following table is the canonical, binding distinction between the two systems. Implementers MUST NOT collapse rows.

| Aspect | Scoring System | Grading System |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| What it is | How tests are **evidenced** (one score per test / per dimension) | How a **grade** (a letter mark) is derived from a collection of scores |
| Input | Test outcome (HTTP status, LLM answer, imports scan, documentation match) | Collection of scores from the Scoring System |
| Output | Numerical score `1.0`–`5.0` or enum `pass` / `fail` / `stale` per dimension | Aggregate grade `A` / `B` / `C` / `D` / `F`, or `REJECTED` (on Categorical Veto) |
| What its updates change | How tests are evidenced (e.g. a new HTTP heuristic). Tracked under spec version `scoringSystem/X.Y.Z` | Thresholds, weights, tier trim, Veto list. Tracked under spec version `gradingSystem/X.Y.Z` |
| Reproducibility | Score is reproducible given identical inputs AND identical `scoringSystem` version | Grade is reproducible given identical scores AND identical `gradingSystem` version |

---

## Versioning Schema

The two systems carry **two independent SemVer namespaces**:

| Namespace | Pattern | Bumped when |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `scoringSystem/X.Y.Z` | `^scoringSystem/\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` | A scoring rule, heuristic, or evidence-extraction changes such that the score output for the same input changes |
| `gradingSystem/X.Y.Z` | `^gradingSystem/\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` | Thresholds, weights, tier trim rules, Categorical-Veto trigger list, or aggregation logic change such that the grade output for the same score input changes |

SemVer semantics (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) apply per namespace independently. The two namespaces are NOT lock-stepped.

The third namespace `gradingSpec/X.Y.Z` (the document set you are reading) is versioned separately again — see [`00-overview.md`](/grading/overview/), "Three Independently Versioned Namespaces".

---

## Binding Rules

The following rules are **binding** for every grader, scorer, and aggregator that conforms to `gradingSpec/2.0.0`.

1. **Both version strings MUST be present in every grading entry.** Every grading entry (defined in [`08-grading-model.md`](/grading/grading-model/)) MUST carry both `scoringSystem` and `gradingSystem` as top-level version fields. A grading entry that lacks either field is INVALID. The same two version strings are additionally surfaced in the `index.json` rollup (per namespace and per selection), so the version under which an aggregated node was last scored and graded is visible without opening each grading entry.
2. **Scoring-System bump and Grading-System bump are independent triggers.** A change in the Scoring System triggers a **re-scoring** at the next re-grading run, but does NOT automatically bump the Grading System. A change in the Grading System triggers a **re-grading** but does NOT automatically bump the Scoring System. Implementers MUST NOT couple the two version namespaces.
3. **Example (HTTP-429 heuristic).** Suppose the current versions are `scoringSystem/1.0.0` and `gradingSystem/1.0.0`. A maintainer decides that HTTP `429` ("rate-limited, retry") MUST be scored as a transient defect (not `fail`). The Scoring System advances to `scoringSystem/1.1.0`. The Grading System remains at `gradingSystem/1.0.0` because the score-to-grade mapping is unchanged. New grading entries record `scoringSystem/1.1.0` + `gradingSystem/1.0.0`; old entries remain at `1.0.0/1.0.0` until they are re-scored.

---

### Score-to-Grade Thresholds (`gradingSystem/1.0.0`)

The aggregate grade is derived from the weighted mean of the per-answer scores. Each answer contributes a numeric value on the `1.0`–`5.0` scale: `pass` maps to `5.0`, `fail` to `1.0`, numeric scores as-is. `n/a` and `stale` answers are excluded from the mean (an all-excluded set yields no grade, i.e. a `pending` node). The mean is then banded:

| Weighted mean | Grade |
|---------------|-------|
| ≥ 4.5 | A |
| ≥ 3.5 | B |
| ≥ 2.5 | C |
| ≥ 1.5 | D |
| < 1.5 | F |

**Tier trim.** The banded grade is capped at the tier maximum: `autonomous` → `B`, `group-bound` → `A`. A score that would band to `A` on an `autonomous`-tier node is recorded as `B` (the pre-trim band is preserved as `rawGrade`). A Categorical Veto overrides the entire computation with `REJECTED`.

Changing any threshold, the tier-trim rule, or the numeric mapping bumps the `gradingSystem` version.

## Relationship to the Schemas-Spec v4.2.0

The Schemas-Spec v4.2.0 provides the **upstream contract** for scoring: the `prompts.json` / `scores.json` artefact pair is defined in [`22-scoring-protocol.md`](/specification/scoring-protocol/) of the Schemas-Spec (sister repository `flowmcp-spec`). The Scoring System named here **sub-consumes** that protocol: scores produced by the Schemas-Spec scoring protocol enter this spec's Scoring System as inputs, and the dimensions enumerated in [`08-grading-model.md`](/grading/grading-model/), "Dimension Enum", extend that protocol with the additional grading dimensions defined here.

This Grading-Spec does NOT re-define the `prompts.json` / `scores.json` contract. Implementers MUST treat the Schemas-Spec v4.2.0 `22-scoring-protocol.md` as the **highest instance** for the artefact pair; conflicting prose in this spec is to be read as a refinement, not as a replacement.
